The project is titled \"Social Upliftment of rural women in Gautambuddha Nagar of Uttar Pradesh through Sustainable Income Generation & Reviving of 7 Water Bodies by clearing them of Water Hyacinth.\" Since ,water hyacinth is a big problem for a lot of water bodies. The growth leads to the complete destruction of the water body as it leads to complete cut off of the sunlight penetrating into the water because of which rest of the ecosystem of the water body becomes non-existent. The simple solution to the above-mentioned problem is that the water hyacinth be removed so that the water body can be revived and the ecosystem would come back to life. Hence, the proposed project is for revival of 7 such water bodies around Gautambuddha Nagar of Uttar Pradesh. Along with reviving the water bodies, the proposed project is also going to provide income generation activities to the 140 women beneficiaries. These women beneficiaries would be provided with training in removal of water hyacinth to a 90% and then to make marketable useful products out of the extracted stems of water hyacinth. The project would solve two problems, one it would revive the water bodies which have become non-use worthy, namely 7 water bodies/ponds in 7 different villages of Gautambuddha Nagar of Uttar Pradesh. Two, it would provide sustainable income generation to the women beneficiaries in the villages right in their original habitation."

In developing countries like ours , women's choices of menstrual hygiene materials are often limited by the costs, availability and social norms. Adequate sanitation facilities and access to feminine hygiene products are one part of the solution. Along with this we also need to create a culture that welcomes discussion and makes adequate education for women and girls. There needs to be an awareness about periods and related hygiene, the diseases which women might catch if they don't stay hygienic during this time like using old clothes, using the same cloth for long periods etc. Our main motive is to spread this awareness amongst female that how important it is for them to stay clean and hygienic in this time. Our government has also taken initiative on providing female hygiene products as extremely cheap rates which many of women donâ€™t even know about as per our data and observation. We conduct awareness camps in underprivileged areas to educate them about the same.",
